## Keep your computer awake without installing software

#### Coffee is a powershell application that was complied into a Windows Binary (EXE) for your convenience. Note that the 'coffee-gui.ps1' and 'Coffee.exe' will operate the same- feel free to read through the source code and run the .ps1 script instead of the EXE if you dont trust blindly running executables.

#

> Note some Anti-Virus programs will flag this executable because it isn't signed, etc. If you don't trust it then please use the raw script instead. [VirusTotal Link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d570f91f7eb55d49a60c20b3299bcbca95b846bbbd875ebc3dc7dee5674362f1?nocache=1)
